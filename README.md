## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

@nxlv/python
https://github.com/lucasvieirasilva/nx-plugins/blob/main/packages/nx-python/README.md

The @nxlv/python plugin is designed to extend Nx’s features with Python projects, and it is based on Poetry.

Poetry is a dependency management and packaging tool for Python. It aims to be a more user-friendly alternative to tools like pip and virtualenv and focuses on simplifying the process of managing dependencies and publishing Python packages.

Some key features of the @nxlv/python include the following:

Local dependencies: It uses the Poetry config (pyproject.toml) to identify the local dependencies and let Nx manage the dependency graph.
Built-in executors: Support for linting, testing, and build tasks.
Embed local dependencies: A project could have multiple local dependencies. In the build time, the @nxlv/python embeds the local code and the external dependencies, so the build artifact file does not require any local dependency to be published to use it.
Isolate dependencies: By default, the @nxlv/python manages the projects individually, so all the projects have one set of dependencies and virtual environments.
Shared virtual environment: When the project contains many external dependencies, installing the dependencies for each project individually becomes a long and heavy task. To solve this issue, if the project contains a pyproject.toml at the root, you can use the root project config to manage all projects. This way, you only need to install the dependencies at the root level. However, this feature requires all the projects to avoid dependency conflicts between them.
Serverless framework: Support serverless framework features to package and deploy
